# SeiunEngine

**你知道吗：** 如果你去催促一个开发者更新你想要的内容和优化，你可能等来的并不是你想要的更新，而是停更。我很想把这一个引擎做好，但我的实力就摆在那儿，请不要过度期待。

A Friday Night Funkin' engine, forked from Psych Engine 0.6.3. Built for the Mandela Funkin Night mod.

**Note:** This project uses AI-assisted tools in its development.

**中文版：[ZHREADME.md](./ZHREADME.md)**

## Supported platforms

- Windows

- macOS
- Linux
- Android
- iOS — builds, but untested. No idea if it actually runs.

No HTML5 build.

## Building

You need Haxe 4.2.5.

```sh
haxelib setup .haxelib
haxe -cp ./setup -main Main --interp
lime build windows
```

Other targets: `lime build mac`, `lime build linux`, `lime build android`, `lime build ios -arm64`.

You can also build via the Build workflow on GitHub Actions (manual trigger, pick a platform, download the artifact).

## Dependencies

See `hmm.json`. Seven of them are forks of mine:

- flixel
- hxvlc
- extension-androidtools
- linc_luajit-rewriten
- openfl
- lime
- hscript

### Classpath overrides (engine patches, tracked in `source/`)

The engine patches a few library classes by overriding them on the `source/`
classpath. The libraries themselves are **not** vendored into this repo.

| override file | patches |
|---|---|
| `source/flixel/system/FlxSound.hx` | flixel (mohong2/flixel) |
| `source/flixel/animation/FlxAnimationController.hx` | flixel (mohong2/flixel) |
| `source/flixel/system/ui/FlxSoundTray.hx` | flixel (mohong2/flixel) |
| `source/flixel/addons/display/FlxRuntimeShader.hx` | engine-added class |
| `source/flixel/addons/ui/FlxInputText.hx` | flixel-ui |
| `source/flixel/addons/ui/FlxUIInputText.hx` | flixel-ui |
| `source/lime/_internal/backend/native/NativeAudioSource.hx` | lime |
| `source/openfl/display/FPS.hx` | openfl |
| `source/openfl/display/OldFPS.hx` | engine-added class |

> TODO: push these patches to their upstream repos (mohong2/flixel, etc.) and
> drop the `source/` overrides once the forks carry them.

## Mods

Drop mods into `mods/`. See `Modding.md`.
